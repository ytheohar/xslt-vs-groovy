# xslt-vs-groovy
Demo, showing how Groovy can be used for XML transformation in place of XSLT

This will take as input the current XML data of [the Sky Sports Football Feed](http://www.skysports.com/sitemap_news_football.xml) and will transform the XML into an HTML file 'out.html'

Alternatively, run: skyfeed localfile
where 'localfile' is the path of the XML file doanloaded from [the Sky Sports Football Feed](http://www.skysports.com/sitemap_news_football.xml) at some point of time.
E.g. run: skyfeed sitemap_news_football.xml
